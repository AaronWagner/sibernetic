Smoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamics
===============================

This is a C++ implementation of the [Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed-particle_hydrodynamics) algorithm for the [OpenWorm](http://openworm.org) project.

There is also a separate effort to port this code to Java, as part of the Geppetto simulation framework.
